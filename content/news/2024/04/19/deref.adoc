Welcome to the Clojure Deref! This is a weekly link/news roundup for the Clojure ecosystem (feed: https://clojure.org/feed.xml[RSS]). Thanks to Anton Fonarev for link aggregation.

== From the core

We have three big chunks of work remaining for 1.12. The first one, reworking the symbolic array type representation is complete, is captured in https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/CLJ-2807[CLJ-2807]. That will rollback the previous implementation added in alpha6 and replace it with a new representation. Array symbols will have the syntax `ComponentType/dimension`, eg `String/1` or `long/2`. More to say on that when we release.

The second piece is reworking the method value and param-tags implementation. The big picture is that param-tags must resolve to a single method, and that qualified methods will otherwise support reflective invocation. Additionally, we're going to alter the syntax of qualified instance methods to make them distinct with Classname/.method (vs Classname/method for static). There are existing cases in the JDK (Double.isNaN()) that have both static and instance methods that overlap in effective arity (instance methods take the instance object as first "arg") - method values have no way to differentiate between these and that was causing a lot of pain in the implementation. This work is nearing completion.

The final piece is functional interface conversion. We've been working through some of the implementation details and figuring out some of the gnarly bits of optimizing method values passed as FIs (avoiding intermediate thunks or converters). This piece is also getting close. At an interim point this week I ran some wide regression testing and found a few interesting cases, some were actual bugs I found in the wild, some were things I was able to smooth over in the implementation. Integrating all of the things above cleanly has been quite challenging, but we are getting close.

Have been working on Clojure/Conj stuff too, hoping to get info about CFP, tickets, and sponsorship out in the next month.
