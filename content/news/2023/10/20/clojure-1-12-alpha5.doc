== Avoid user code with I/O under synchronized blocks

Java 21 LTS introduced virtual threads (aka Project Loom). Virtual threads may be paused and resumed and cooperate with many blocking operations in the JDK - I/O, ReentrantLock, etc. However, Java 21 does not allow pausing of synchronization on object monitors (synchronized) and will thus "pin" the virtual thread to a carrier thread if blocking while synchronized.

This release modifies `lazy-seq` and `delay` to use ReentrantLock instead of synchronized to avoid this issue.
